Inviting PhatBot
================

Inviting PhatBot to your server is super simple, but it does require a password to access the invite link. This is something you can only do by being part of the `Pixel Allaince`_ crew and checking out the #resources channel in Discord!

Go to https://phat32.tv/add-phatbot and enter the password.

Select the server to add PhatBot too, and add them! New roles will be created specifically for PhatBot.

Once added, move the PhatBot Role to where you want in the permission structure. Make sure it is below any moderator levels otherwise users can give themselves mod powers.
