Inviting PhatBot to your server
-------------------------------

Inviting PhatBot to your server is super simple, but it does require a password to access the invite link. This is something you can do by being part of the `Pixel Alliance`__ crew and heading over to the #resources channel in Discord!

**Invite Link**: https://phat32.tv/add-phatbot

Once added to the server, a new PhatBot role will be created specifically for PhatBot. I highly recommend moving the PhatBot Role to where you want in the permission structure. Make sure it is below any moderator levels otherwise users can give themselves mod powers.

Example, if the permission tree is setup like this

- Admin

- PhatBot

- Mod

- Members

Then using the **!addrole** command, users could add Mod to their roles. Ideally it should be structered more like this

- Admin

- Mod

- PhatBot

- Members
