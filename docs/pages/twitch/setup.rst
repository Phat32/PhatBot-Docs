Getting Started
===============

Add PhatBot to my Channel
-------------------------

If you are a crew mate in the `Pixel Alliance`__ team, PhatBot will automatically join your channel! It may take up to a day for PhatBot to join.

If you're not in the Pixel Alliance, you can have PhatBot join your channel by going to `PhatBots Twitch Page`__ and using the command **!join** in chat. This will add PhatBot to your channel, however when the bot reboots it may not automatically re-join at the moment. This is being addressed but will be done later.

Link Discord and Twitch accounts in PhatBot
-------------------------------------------

You can link your Discord account and Twitch accounts inside of PhatBot as the linkage data does not exist as public information. This allows the usage of the Steam Commands in Twitch, as well as makes it possible to enter giveaways if run in a live stream channel!

To link your accounts, in Discord DM PhatBot the following

.. code-block:: none

  !twitch

PhatBot will reply with a unique code to give to PhatBot on Twitch. Take the code and whisper PhatBot 

.. code-block:: none

  !link XXXXXXXX

PhatBot will reply letting you know the link is complete! If there is an error linking it will also inform you of this
