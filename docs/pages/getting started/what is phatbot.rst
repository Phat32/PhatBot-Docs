What is PhatBot
===============


So, what is a PhatBot?
----------------------

PhatBot is a Discord and Twitch Bot created by Phat32_. It was originally created to run giveaways in the `Just Good PC Games`__ Discord server but has since expanded to do much more.

Written in C# and hosted in the cloud, PhatBot is generally always online and hanging out ready to accept your commands

Twitch Chat Relay
-----------------

PhatBot can link a Twitch channels chat to 1 or many Discord channels. So anything said in 1 is relayed to them all!

You can say something in twitch and it will be captured in Discord, or if you're in Discord you can send messages that will appear in Twitch via PhatBot!

This can be a handy tool and neat feature to allow your community to talk to you without leaving Discord. Because it relays to all chats, this includes Discord. If PhatBot is connected to multiple Servers and the Twitch Chat is linked to a channel in each, the chat will go to all servers. Anything said in 1 servers channel will be available in all servers and Twitch equally. It is easy to keep track of the source of the message as it will say **[Twitch]** if it message originated there, other wise it will say the server name like **[Pixel Alliance]** in front of the message
